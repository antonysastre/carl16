### Logic Gates

`/chipsets` -> Hardware chipset for the computer, implemented in the simple descriptive HDL from the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken.

These are categorized by the order they are built and needed. Starting with `combinational` gates (such as Basic AND/OR/NOT, Adders, Mux and the ALU) that then are used to build the `sequential` gates (such as Bit, DFF, RAM, Memory, CPU and the Computer).
